Process over Delphi Forms (.dfm) files via an AST

Inspired by the excellent PostCSS tool, motivated by my rage at the Delphi IDE

## Work In Progress

This project is still a work in progress. If you would like to use the half-baked code right now, run the following:

```shell
# npm
$ npm install @postdfm/dfm2ast

# yarn
$ yarn add @postdfm/dfm2ast
```

Otherwise, if you want to give me a hand, head over to the issues on GitHub and have a look at what needs to be done.
